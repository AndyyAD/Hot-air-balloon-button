# Hot-air-balloon-button

This is a button hover effect of Hot air balloon made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

When you click the button the message gets transferred to the hot air balloon and it flies off to send your message.

If you want you can optimize the code and send me pull request. If I like it I will push it to my repo. Make sure while commiting you describe everything you've done.
